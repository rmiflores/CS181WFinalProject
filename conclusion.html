	<h1> CS 181W Final Project: The Value of Privacy </h1>
	<h3> By Ramon Flores, Daniel Liem, Ryan Perez, and John Wu </h3>

	<br>

	<div>
		<h2> Privacy from a Utilitarian Perspective </h2>
		<p class = "centered"> Do each of these countries' policies provide the greatest good for the greatest amount of people? </p>

		<h4> <a href="#"> United States </a> </h4>

		<ul>
			<li> <p> The United States is divided on the direction it wishes to advance towards in terms of cyber privacy </p> </li>
			<li> <p> If implemented as planned, these attempted bills should increase utility as the threat of cybercrime would decrease, and no innocent’s privacy would be violated </p> </li>
			<li> <p> However, it is impossible to say now if the laws would be exploitative or not, and if they were, the privacy loss of plentiful citizens decreases the overall utility exponentially. </p> </li>
		</ul>

		<br>

		<h4> <a href="#"> India </a> </h4>

		<ul>
			<li> <p> The Indian government and people both realize the important of personal security, but the government does a poor job in satisfying the needs to the people </p> </li>
			<li> <p> The government draws an ambiguous line between what should be accessed or not </p> </li>
			<li> <p> The overall utility is decreased because the Indian people have become unnecessarily cautious about what they post due to its ability to be accessed </p> </li>
		</ul>

		<br>

		<h4> <a href="#"> South Korea </a> </h4>

		<ul>
			<li> <p> The government has full access and is constantly regulating the internet, and the majority of the public feels safe; they accept having the government control privacy </p> </li>
			<li> <p> In terms of a Utilitarian’s perspective: less privacy is better for Korea, keeping the country very regulated. The more government involvement, the better </p> </li>
		</ul>

		<br>

		<h4> <a href="#"> China </a> </h4>

		<ul>
			<li> <p> China places limits on the privacy of netizens to retain a closer grip on maintaining political stability </p> </li>
			<li> <p> Ideally, should lead to increased utility due to less conflict as a whole </p> </li>
			<li> <p> In reality, lowers individual utility by reducing tendencies to speak due to fear of prosecution from the government, lowering the likelihood of whistleblowing too </p> </li>
		</ul>
